 HW 18: Iterate on Your Portfolio and Code Responsive Design Elements 
 
 Last week, you started laying the groundwork for your UX/UI portfolio website during the Unit 16 Challenge by building the wireframe you designed during Week 16. This week we will continue to work on your portfolio by applying CSS Flex, CSS Grid, and media queries to make your UX/UI portfolio responsive. In this assignment, you will use CSS Flex to build a layout showcasing your UX skills. You will also use CSS Grid to create content for the case study you generated during Week 16. On top of this, you will continue to polish your UX/UI portfolio website’s CSS to make your site more attractive and employer-competitive. 
 
 User Story: As UX/UI professionals, accessibility is critical for your portfolio page. You must not operate under the assumption that your site will only be browsed via desktop. In today’s busy world, it's entirely possible that your target audience will not check out your work by desktop and browse on their mobile devices instead. This week is your chance to illustrate your front-end development skills by building flexible content that shows off your work and makes your UX/UI portfolio responsive.
